## Assessment

Nu.nl, one of the Netherlands most-popular newssites, offers RSS feeds. 

With the provided API boilerplate, We would like to see you create:
- an endpoint to query at least one rss feed
- store the information in a data store of your choice for caching and faster subsequent requests
- support filters and sorting to reshape the data response

We don't want to restrict you too much so feel free to scope the project to your time and needs. 
However; make sure there is enough code (written by yourself) to explain your design and approach.

*Be creative, be awesome!*
